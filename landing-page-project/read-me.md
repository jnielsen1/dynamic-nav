This is a dynamic langing page that includes a navigation bar built from javascript. 
The code identifies section tags and automatically adds them to the navigation bar with their title. 
Clicking the navigation bar takes you to their location on the page. 
On scroll, the code identifies when a section is in the viewport and the background of that section changes.  

This was a fun and challenging project to workthrough, and key lessons learned were how to loop through a page with javascript and update styling along the way.
